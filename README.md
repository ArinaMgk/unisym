# UNISYM

**Uniformed Symbol**, also known as "Uniform Symbolic Assembly and Implementation", which are based on the interfaces of official library or conventional styles, e.g. *ISO/IEC STD-C Interfaces*.

The project is open-sourced under license of *Apache 2.0*. If you copy the code and used for the public or commercial, please **stipulate your copying from UNISYM led by<font color="purple"> ArinaMgk </font> **. All the code is by hands, without copying anyone including artificial intelligence, so these big changes and mistakes in codes may be forgiven .

The project is always non-political and non-economic.

| Kasha              | x86-Series Platform Assembly Kit (kernel) for Operation System Development. |
| cpp                | only for C++ Programming Language. |
| <del>MCU</del> | for integrated micro-controller units. (temporarily close-src, as `unisyml`) |
