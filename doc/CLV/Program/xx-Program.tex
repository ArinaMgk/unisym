The concept of `state machine' is widely accepted, for it describing the effect of the instructions, which can help us to get numeric register-effects and other side-effects.

For example, the rules of conversion from function calling, entering(including allocating stack and others), leaving and evaluation to assembly implementation should be specific.

\subsubsection{Hosted Environment}

In Freestanding Environment, user can only use inline assembly, memory and arithmetic effect. However, the hosted includes at least interfaces provided by Operating System and Processor-registered mechanism, which provide much side-effect.

Usually to see demo `args':

But the ISO/IEC recommend the below forms for `main' function with external symbol \verb`_main`:
