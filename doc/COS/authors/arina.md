## View

- Only under the definition of concepts can we judge things completely logical true and false;
- Instances are more vivid than their abstracts, and abstracts ultimately come from instances;
- It tends to be unified and symmetrical on the whole;
- Among competing theories, the simpler explanation of an entity is to be preferred;
- What you feel is directly dependent on your sensory organs and signal processing systems.
