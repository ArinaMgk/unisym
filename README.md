# UNISYM

**Uniformed (Universal) Symbol**, also known as "*Uniform Symbolic System*", which is a system of programming, including not only implementation, library, tool-kits, displaying engine and demonstrations. The repository is open-sourced under license of *Apache 2.0*. If you copy the code and used for the public or commercial, please stipulate your copying from *UNISYM* led by *ArinaMgk*. 

All the code is by hands, without copying anyone including artificial intelligence, so these big changes and mistakes in codes may be forgiven.

> Where to see the "Uni-" and "-Sym", for example, there are harmonious identifications for linkage-identifiers and calling-parameters,

ConPrint("Hello") # Some script-interpret

ConPrint("Hello");/* CPL */

Con::Print("Hello");// C++
Con.Print("Hello");// C++

ConPrint Hello_String; Assembly Macro
