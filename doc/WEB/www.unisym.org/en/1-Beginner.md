> The meaning of UNISYM is not the perfect, but herself.

### Mind them when changing modules

- **Target**: every file should consider each target (instruction/register architecture + board platform). They should be registered in mdFiles, too;
- **Manual**: every function / object should own its.
- **Gene-3**;

### About Generation-3

Before `U2025SPR`, although some new characters will be added, the old style will be kept, but it is not recommended to use them.

- Guiding head file, like `inc/cpp/uint48`;
- Use `.lib` for normal with weak linkage. use `.c` and other source files if you need to debug them;
- Mainly for `4X\4` aka C++, C#, Rust languages and begin developing Magice;
- C++ based on C to cut duplication;
- `_INCPP_...` rather than `_INC_..._X`, also `_INM_...` for Magice;
- new format of target names
