- use `STM32F103VEx` without macro but only `stdinc.h` with the macro, more to see in `6-Depend.md`;

## Requirements from future versions for contributors

- rigorous headers;
- rigorous {*ATTRIBUTIVE*} comments and solving them: {TODO} {TEMP};


## For ISO/IEC CPL Standard Library

- CPL: ISO-C99
- C++: ISO-C++11/C++17
