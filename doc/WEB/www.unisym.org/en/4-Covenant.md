Her-style, Code-reusing and Conceptual-razor.

## Covenant

- For C
    - `{memmec}` All address are logic address and the relative addresses are continuous.
    - `{memmec}` Default decreasing stack(SS:SP) direction.
    - `{digit }` Default binary and bitwise operations.
    - `{endian}` Default little endian.
- `NULL` = `nullptr` = 0x0 â‰  0.0
- `sizeof` `std(/u/s)int` == address of pointer == `size_t` == `ptrdiff_t` 


## Naming Rules

- ANY
	- old style `NUMBER`
- C
    - header style `number.h` 
    - `number_t`  style for struct name
    - `AOpqr` style for  function identifier
	- old style `number`
- C++ 
    - header style `number` 
    - `Number_T` style for template name
	- `Number` 
    - namespace `uni` 
    - `AbcdOpqr` style for class name and function identifier
    - `abcdOpqr` style for object of the type AbcdOpqr or other types
    - unisym formal style:
        - If a reference return may point to `nullptr`, make a `ERR` object in the class to occupy the condition but use Exception System. 
        - Usually the content can be cast into boolean object, which is compared with ERR, or we can use the parent/manager item acting as it.
    - the prefix `set`, `get` are all in lower-style
- C#
    - namespace `Unisym` 

- Real-16: The symbols are without '_' prefix.
- Line-64: The symbols are with double '_' prefix.
- Avoid using reference& but pointer* for inside function for more simply transplant.
- Use `uint8`, `uint16` and so on, as integer types.

- prefix`get`, suffix`Get` and midfix`_get`

---

- Pointers
	- `offs` a $void*$ pointer, it cannot be added to integers in some compilers for its non-size;
	- `addr` a $char*$ or $byte*$ pointer, usually unioned with `offs` (an alias);


### delay

instructional delay: in file whose name including a frequency, e.g. `delay11M.asm`;

timer delay: in file whose name does not, e.g. `delay.c`;


## Contributing Rules 

Tendency

- use `nullptr` 
- (TODO) wizard: from .mgc/.mgh -> .cpp/.h
