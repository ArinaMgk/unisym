AASM / NASM specifies that all labels are addresses but accessing, which is different from that of C, whose array labels indicate objects but addresses.
For some assemblers, there are for a same value:

\verb|[A+B+1]|; \verb|[A+OFFSET(B)+1]|; \verb|1[A][B]|.

And there are for another value:

\verb|A|; \verb|[A]|; \verb|[OFFSET A]|.

\refer{Magice} uses AASM, which is a middle language, supporting automatically inline cross-platform AASM. If native assembly statements are used, the program will be degraded and deprived cross-platform property.
