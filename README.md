# UNISYM

**Uniformed (Universal) Symbol**, also known as "*Uniform Symbolic Assembly and Implementation*", "*Pseudo Standard Library*" or "*Her-Interfaces*", which are based on the interfaces of official library or conventional styles, e.g. *ISO/IEC STD-C Interfaces*.

The UNISYM is like GNU-LIB with demonstrations and documents, which help compilers act among not only  translation of simple assembly instructions but also provide binary and linkages.

The project is open-sourced under license of *Apache 2.0*. If you copy the code and used for the public or commercial, please stipulate your copying from UNISYM led by<font color="purple"> ArinaMgk </font> . All the code is by hands, without copying anyone including artificial intelligence, so these big changes and mistakes in codes may be forgiven .

For example:

```
ConPrint("Hello") # Some script-interpret

ConPrint("Hello");/* CPL */

Con::Print("Hello");// C++
Con.Print("Hello");// C++

ConPrint Hello_String; Assembly Macro

...
```



The project is always non-political and non-economic.
