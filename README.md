# UNISYM

**Uniformed Symbol**, also known as "*Uniform Symbolic Assembly and Implementation*", "*Pseudo Standard Library*" or "*Her-Interfaces*", which are based on the interfaces of official library or conventional styles, e.g. *ISO/IEC STD-C Interfaces*.

The UNISYM is like GNU-LIB with demonstrations and documents, which help compilers act among not only  translation of simple assembly instructions but also provide binary and linkages.

The project is open-sourced under license of *Apache 2.0*. If you copy the code and used for the public or commercial, please **stipulate your copying from UNISYM led by<font color="purple"> ArinaMgk </font> **. All the code is by hands, without copying anyone including artificial intelligence, so these big changes and mistakes in codes may be forgiven .

For example:

```
ConPrint("Hello") # Some script-interpret

ConPrint("Hello");/* CPL */

Con::Print("Hello");// C++
Con.Print("Hello");// C++

ConPrint Hello_String; Assembly Macro

...
```



The project is always non-political and non-economic.

### Component

Some code depend on the standard or widely-used functions; some code are supported by the complete UNISYM codes, such as *Kasha*.

| Folder Name        | For                                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Analog | Design-Metadata and products of the non-digital. |
| Graphic | Any chrome relatives. |
| Hardware | Mainly for Verilog and VHDL, now. |
| Model | 3D-Print... |
| Kasha              | x86-Series Platform Assembly Kit (kernel) for Operation System Development. (interrupts are in `asm`) |
| Clover           | Symbol-syntax languages support |
| Mark | Rosama system in the future |
| Script | Datura system in the future |
| asm | Host environment assembly |
| c                  | C Programming Language. Some are compatible with C++ with `extern "C"` keyword. |
| <del>MCU</del> | for integrated micro-controller units. (temporarily close-src, as `unisyml`) |

### Format

- `.a` assembly file
- `.a`-suffixed and `n_`-prefixed file is for Arina-made assembler (private so far) , you may also use **NASM0207** as a replacement.
