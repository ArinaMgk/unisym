\begin{enumerate}
	\item Pointer \T{NULL} = 0
	\item Little Endianness
	\item "\T{word}" has fixed double bytes. And the fixed size rule is true for other basic types like "\T{dword}"(four bytes).
	\item A string ends at a zero byte by default, like `ASCIZ'.
	\item byte only for 8 binary digit. (In Classic Mika, BYTE and OCTET always measures 8 binary digits.)
	\item Use string or flexible chars to express \B{date and time} but the only fixed integer
	\item \verb`if(A)` means \verb`if(A!=0)`, and if {A} is a floating number, this is equivalent to \textbf{}`if(A!=0.0)` although the hexadecimal of {0.0} may not be {0} in their structure.
	\item Constant and increasing-ordered, for 0~9, a~z and A~Z in char-sets. %`RFT08`, Haruno appended.
