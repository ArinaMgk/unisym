# UNISYM

Uniformed Symbols, also as "Uniform Symbolic Library".

&emsp;For inline and external symbols; for variables, macros and functions.

&emsp;Based on the official library or conventional styles.

This is still a Œ≤ version. The symbols will be re-formed in the next main version.

If you copy the code and used for the public, please **stipulate your copying from UNISYM led by ArinaMgk**.

### Build - Make into a library

For example, for Windows 64-bit environment, by GCC 8.1.0, and in the parent directory, you can text your Makefile script:

```makefile
u64:
	gcc -c ./unisym/c/source/*.c -m64 -D_dbg -O3 -s -lm -D_WinNT
	ar rcs usym64.lib *.o
	del *.o
```

`ustring`: the operations for string and big-integer-number„ÄåÂ§ßÊï∏ÈÅãÁÆó„Äç (flexible-size). Besides, this contains: SystemConversion„ÄåÈÄ≤Âà∂ËΩâÊèõ„Äç; The "u" is for distinction from that of the standard library, which means "UNISYM", **but "Unicode"**. This is going to divide into "hstring" and "bstring", and "usting" will include them.

`dnode`: double-direction node.

- `.a`-suffixed file is for Arina-made assembler (private so far) , you may also use NASM0207.



### TODO

- Simply-used version of each potential function.



### Source

Except stipulation, all codes are produced by the contributors but the others. **If the codes rise any mistake while you use the codes in your important service, the contributors should not help you and your loss!**
