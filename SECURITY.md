## Test

`*/test/*` are not confirmed to be executable. 

## Update Strategy

Because only few organizations have forked the UNISYM, the big changes will be done without log (file `/UPDATE.md`) in the specific documents.

If any function changed, the test program in `/*/test/`should be updated or confirm the program is still adaptive.

The private document project: **Heri-note**

Usual update strategy:

- over 12 files or over 21 lines changed
- <del>about 30 days from last commit</del> each Sunday 
- Others' request
