
The concept of `state machine' is widely accepted, for it describing the effect of the instructions, which can help us to get numeric register-effects and other side-effects.

For example, the rules of conversion from function calling, entering(including allocating stack and others), leaving and evaluation to assembly implementation should be specific.

Compared with C++, CPL has
no override,
no class pre-parameter(\verb`this`), 
no references(\verb`&`),
no pre-constructure(calling in global area, beyond any procedure block), % int l = strlen("a");// this may happen without control
so it does not own complex reflect.

\subsubsection{Control Transfer}

\verb`goto label` is equivalent to \verb`jmp label;`.
